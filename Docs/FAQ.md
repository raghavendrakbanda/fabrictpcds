# I get the error 'ERROR: The policy requires the caller...to use on-behalf-of (OBO) flow.' when executing the scripts. 

This is related to using a service principal to perform certain actions and can be fixed by running 'az login' again. We are working on a fix for this issue.
# Do I need to use the DWU 1000 to run my tests?
