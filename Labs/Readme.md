## Lab Guide

- Review [reference architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swanguni/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Benchmark-Testing\/main/Architecture/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Performance-Testing-Reference-Architecture.jpg) with customer to qualify the industry TPC DS approach with customerâ€™s business need for evaluating data platform .

- Review performance testing results metrics with customer to ensure key criteria for price-performance and TCO standard align with customer's expectation including Total Execution Time, Average Time per Query, per User, Throughput, Concurrency, Compute & Storage Cost, etc. 

### Execute the following steps as part of the POC


- Follow the [Azure Services Provision Deck](https://github.com/swanguni/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Benchmark-Testing/tree/main/Labs/Module%201/Readme.md) to create Azure resources required for performance testing workloads.

- Follow the [Benchmark Environment Setup Deck](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/CSUDataAICommunityIPLibrary/EXkHbOTV6MVAlHppIXZj2EsBguN1LPuQyz40f8GSc2Rm6g?e=SNSaqh) to assist customer generate the proper TPC DS testing dataset and batch data loading pipeline

- Guide customer through performance testing tasks, including batch loading, performance testing and concurrency testing using [TPC DS Performance Testing Execution Deck](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/CSUDataAICommunityIPLibrary/EX4ATWqlE-NAp6XNHvqiwIIB7a6xGpT-nRNqrZpSquh9hQ?e=XURISv).

- Work with customer to create performance testing results [EXCEL](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/CSUDataAICommunityIPLibrary/ER6LE9g7QUxMsJ11XBzeRfMBi825EjlPrPrmS5YreU1RFQ?e=ggPQcf) spreadsheet and [PPT](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/CSUDataAICommunityIPLibrary/EQNkr-IjO4dLiKpn10lemEAB8IhcAUAw2_RHNl1reNNu2g?e=KQfcQv).
