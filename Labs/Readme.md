## Lab Guide

- Review [reference architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swanguni/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Benchmark-Testing\/main/Architecture/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Performance-Testing-Reference-Architecture.jpg) with customer to qualify the industry TPC DS approach with customerâ€™s business need for evaluating data platform .

- Review performance testing results metrics with customer to ensure key criteria for price-performance and TCO standard align with customer's expectation including Total Execution Time, Average Time per Query, per User, Throughput, Concurrency, Compute & Storage Cost, etc. 

### Execute the following steps as part of the POC


- Follow the steps in [Module 1](https://github.com/swanguni/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Benchmark-Testing/tree/main/Labs/Module%201/Readme.md) to create Azure resources required for performance testing workloads.

- Follow the steps in [Module 2](https://github.com/swanguni/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Benchmark-Testing/tree/main/Labs/Module%202/Readme.md) to assist customer generate the proper TPC DS testing dataset and batch data loading pipeline

- Guide customer through performance testing tasks, including batch loading, performance and concurrency testing using [Module 3](https://github.com/swanguni/Azure-Synapse-TPC-DS-Benchmark-Testing/tree/main/Labs/Module%203/Readme.md).

- Work with customer to create performance testing results templates
